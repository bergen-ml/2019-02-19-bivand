# Introduction

## Outline

- Spatial and spatio-temporal data are characterised by structures that distinguish them from typical tabular data

- The geometric structures also have spatial reference system information, and can adhere to standards, which may ease geometrical operations

- Satellite data and numerical model output data typically have regular grid structures, but these are often domain-specific

- Computationally intensive tasks include interpolation, upsampling, focal operations, change of support and handling vector data with very detailed boundaries, as well as modelling using Bayesian inference

- A further challenge to modelling using training sets with spatial data is how to split the observations in the presence of spatial dependence
